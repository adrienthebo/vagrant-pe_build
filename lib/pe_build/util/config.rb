  # Merge configuration classes together with the "local" object overwriting any
  # values set in the "other" object. This uses the default merging in the Vagrant
  # plugin config class. The builtin merge function is not straight forward however.
  # It needs to be called on the object being overwritten. When using a subclass of
  # a global config for a provisioner config, the builtin merge method cannot actually
  # merge them in the direction that would be needed.
  #
  # This function assumes that the "local" object is of the same class or at the very
  # least a subclass of "other".
  #
  # @param [Object] Local configuration class to merge
  # @param [Object] Other configuration class to merge
  # @return [Object] New object of the same class as Local that represents the merged result
